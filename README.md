# booksAPI
This is going to be a simple API project.

To keep track of books in a bookstore. 
Remember CRUD stands for create, read, update and delete.
Follow the standard API conventions i have learned including http methods and status codes. 

A bookstore contacted i because they need a website and mobile application to streamline the management of their books. 
From the website and mobile app managers should be able to add and edit books quickly.
And visitors should be able to browse the available book collection with no problem.
So for this project i will develop APIs that support these features. 
First, to store the books in the database, i need a storage space or table. 
And i need a Django model to manipulate and define how the data will be stored in a table. 
Django models work like a bridge between the data and my business logic.
